Charter Schools seem to be using government funds better when it comes to learning results. 
All of the top schools belong to the type Charter Schools, while the bottom schools are all District Schools. 

One might think that the students from schools with higher budgets would perform better in math 
and reading and in overall ratings, however, the data shows that the schools with lower budgets are doing better. 
We will need to check what type of facilities do the larger and with higher budget schools have. They might be 
spending their money on maintaining bigger facilities, better amenities for students and teachers, and leaving 
aside the educational factors. 

Schools with less students do not necesarily mean less budget assigned, so we should take a look in the way the
middle size schools are taking advantage of their funds.
